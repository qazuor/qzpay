## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 91c9a5c: fix(core,drizzle): atomic promo code redemption (race-safe)

  The previous `promoCodes.apply()` flow had a read-then-write race
  condition: `validate()` would check `currentRedemptions < maxRedemptions`,
  then `incrementRedemptions()` would unconditionally add 1. Two concurrent
  redeems near the limit could both pass validation, leading to a final
  counter that exceeds `maxRedemptions`.

  **Core (`@qazuor/qzpay-core`)**:

  - `QZPayPromoCodeStorage` gains `atomicIncrementRedemptions(id): Promise<QZPayPromoCode | null>`.
    Storage adapters MUST implement this as a single conditional UPDATE
    (e.g. `UPDATE ... WHERE redemptions < max RETURNING *`). Returns `null`
    when the increment would exceed the cap.
  - The legacy `incrementRedemptions()` is kept for backwards compatibility
    but marked `@deprecated`.
  - `promoCodes.apply()` now uses the atomic method and throws
    `QZPayConflictError` (`conflictType: 'promo_code_limit_reached'`) when
    the storage layer returns `null`.

  **Drizzle (`@qazuor/qzpay-drizzle`)**:

  - `QZPayPromoCodesRepository.atomicIncrementUsage(id)` implements the
    conditional UPDATE against `billing_promo_codes`.
  - `drizzleStorage.promoCodes.atomicIncrementRedemptions()` wires it
    through with the existing mapper.
  - Integration tests cover: happy path, overshoot returns null, no-limit
    (`maxUses === null`) never blocks, and a concurrent-redeem race with
    `Promise.all` against `maxUses = 2 / 10 contenders` showing exactly 2
    successes.

- 773d418: feat(mp): enrich checkout adapter with payer info, category_id, idempotency, statement_descriptor

  Brings the MercadoPago checkout adapter (`QZPayMercadoPagoCheckoutAdapter`)
  to parity with the hand-rolled direct-SDK path that Hospeda built in
  SPEC-109 Phase 1. All of these are part of MP's 14-item quality
  checklist and improve fraud-engine approval rates.

  **`@qazuor/qzpay-core`** — `QZPayCreateCheckoutInput` gains:

  - `customerName?: string`
  - `payerFirstName?: string`
  - `payerLastName?: string`
  - `idempotencyKey?: string`
  - `statementDescriptor?: string`

  And `QZPayCheckoutLineItem` gains:

  - `categoryId?: string`

  All optional and backwards-compatible.

  **`@qazuor/qzpay-mercadopago`** — the checkout adapter now:

  - Sets `items[].category_id` on every item (default `'services'` for SaaS;
    callers can override per-line-item).
  - Populates `payer` with `email + first_name + last_name`. Priority:
    explicit `payerFirstName`/`payerLastName` → split `customerName` on
    first space → fall back to email local-part. `last_name` is never
    empty (MP rejects empty strings; falls back to a single space).
  - Forwards `idempotencyKey` via `requestOptions: { idempotencyKey }`
    when provided.
  - Validates `statementDescriptor` format (`/^[A-Z0-9 ]{1,11}$/`) and
    forwards as `body.statement_descriptor`. Invalid values throw before
    the HTTP round-trip.

  The previous tests that asserted on exact body shape were updated to
  include the new `category_id` (default `'services'`) and the expanded
  `payer` shape.

  Part of SPEC-125 (Phase C of SPEC-122 master plan). Unblocks SPEC-127
  (migration of Hospeda's `addon.checkout.ts` from direct mercadopago SDK
  to `billing.checkout.create()`).

### Patch Changes

- 4425eb6: fix(mp): generate payment idempotency key outside the retry loop

  Before this fix, the `X-Idempotency-Key` for `payment.create()` was generated
  inside the `withRetry()` callback, so every retry attempt produced a fresh
  key. If the first attempt timed out AFTER MercadoPago had actually processed
  the charge, the retry would use a different key and MP would create a
  duplicate payment — silently double-charging the customer.

  The key is now generated once per logical `create()` call and reused across
  all retry attempts. MP's idempotency window will then return the same
  payment on retries instead of charging again.

  `QZPayCreatePaymentInput` also gains an optional `idempotencyKey` field so
  callers can supply their own correlation ID (e.g. a local order UUID) for
  end-to-end traceability. When omitted, the adapter generates `qzpay_<uuid>`
  using `crypto.randomUUID()`.
