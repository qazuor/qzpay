# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to create a changeset

Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset. This will prompt you to:

1. Select the packages that have changed
2. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset will be committed and used during the release process.
