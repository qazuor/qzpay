# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is QZPay?

QZPay is a universal billing and payments library for Node.js applications. It provides a unified API to work with multiple payment providers (Stripe, MercadoPago, etc.) and storage backends (Drizzle, Prisma, etc.), making it easy to implement subscription billing, one-time payments, and entitlement management.

### Why use QZPay instead of using Stripe/MercadoPago directly?

QZPay offers several advantages:

1. **Provider Abstraction** - Switch payment providers without changing your business logic
2. **Unified API** - Same interface regardless of which provider you use
3. **Multi-Provider Support** - Use different providers in different regions
4. **Built-in Entitlements** - Feature gating and usage limits out of the box
5. **Storage Flexibility** - Choose your own database and ORM
6. **React Components** - Pre-built UI components for common billing flows

### Is QZPay production-ready?

Yes. QZPay v1.0 is stable and suitable for production use. The library follows semantic versioning, and breaking changes are documented in the [changelog](/en/resources/changelog/).

### What payment providers are supported?

Currently supported:
- **Stripe** - Full support including subscriptions, payments, invoices, and webhooks
- **MercadoPago** - Full support for Latin American markets

Coming soon:
- PayPal
- Braintree

You can also [create custom adapters](/en/guides/creating-adapters/) for any payment provider.

### What databases are supported?

QZPay supports any database through storage adapters:

- **Drizzle** - Official adapter with full support
- **Custom** - Create adapters for Prisma, TypeORM, or any database

## Licensing

### What license is QZPay released under?

QZPay is released under the MIT license, making it free to use in both commercial and open-source projects.

### Can I use QZPay in commercial projects?

Yes. The MIT license allows commercial use, modification, and distribution.

## Technical Questions

### Does QZPay support TypeScript?

Yes. QZPay is written in TypeScript and provides full type definitions for all APIs. No additional `@types` packages needed.

### What Node.js versions are supported?

QZPay requires Node.js 18 or higher. We recommend using the latest LTS version.

### Can I use QZPay with Next.js/Nuxt/SvelteKit?

Yes. QZPay works with any Node.js framework. The core package runs on the server, and the React package provides client-side components.

```typescript
// Next.js API route example
import { createBilling } from '@qazuor/qzpay-core';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const billing = createBilling({ provider, storage });
  // ...
}
```

### How do I handle multiple currencies?

QZPay supports multi-currency billing. Prices are stored with their currency code:

```typescript
await billing.prices.create({
  productId: 'pro',
  amount: 9900,
  currency: 'usd',
  interval: 'month'
});

await billing.prices.create({
  productId: 'pro',
  amount: 8900,
  currency: 'eur',
  interval: 'month'
});
```

### How do I implement feature flags based on subscription?

Use the entitlements system:

```typescript
// Define entitlements in your plan
const plan = {
  id: 'pro',
  entitlements: ['advanced_export', 'api_access', 'priority_support']
};

// Check entitlements in your code
const hasFeature = await billing.entitlements.check(customerId, 'advanced_export');

// Or use React components
<EntitlementGate feature="advanced_export" fallback={<UpgradePrompt />}>
  <AdvancedExportButton />
</EntitlementGate>
```

### How does usage-based billing work?

QZPay tracks usage and applies limits through the `limits` service:

```typescript
// Record usage
await billing.limits.recordUsage(customerId, 'api_calls', 1);

// Check limits
const limit = await billing.limits.check(customerId, 'api_calls');
if (!limit.allowed) {
  throw new Error('API limit exceeded');
}

console.log(`Used: ${limit.currentValue}/${limit.maxValue}`);
```

### Can I customize the React components?

Yes, in multiple ways:

1. **Theme** - Use `createTheme()` to customize colors, fonts, and spacing
2. **CSS Classes** - All components have BEM-style class names you can override
3. **className Props** - Pass custom classes directly to components
4. **Headless Hooks** - Use hooks like `usePricingTable()` to build fully custom UIs

See the [Styling Components guide](/en/guides/styling-components/) for details.

### How do webhooks work?

QZPay processes webhooks from payment providers and translates them into unified events:

```typescript
// Provider sends webhook
POST /webhooks/stripe
{ "type": "customer.subscription.updated", ... }

// QZPay processes and emits unified event
billing.on('subscription.updated', (event) => {
  // Handle subscription update
});
```

See the [Webhook Handling guide](/en/guides/webhook-handling/) for implementation details.

## Migration

### How do I migrate from Stripe's SDK to QZPay?

QZPay can work alongside existing Stripe code. Start by:

1. Installing QZPay packages
2. Configuring the Stripe adapter with your existing API key
3. Running the sync command to import existing data
4. Gradually replacing direct Stripe calls with QZPay calls

```bash
pnpm qzpay sync --provider stripe
```

See the [Migration Guide](/en/resources/migration/) for detailed steps.

### Can I migrate from one payment provider to another?

Yes, this is one of QZPay's key features. Since all providers use the same interface, you can:

1. Add the new provider adapter
2. Sync existing customers/subscriptions where possible
3. Use the new provider for new customers
4. Gradually migrate existing customers

### Does QZPay support data import/export?

Yes. The CLI provides import/export commands:

```bash
# Export data
pnpm qzpay export --format json --output ./backup.json

# Import data
pnpm qzpay import --file ./backup.json
```

## Pricing & Support

### Is QZPay free?

Yes. QZPay is open-source and free to use. There are no license fees or per-transaction charges from QZPay. You only pay the fees charged by your payment provider.

### How do I get support?

- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and API reference
- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** - Community Q&A

See the [Support page](/en/community/support/) for more details.

### Can I get professional support?

For enterprise support, custom development, or consulting, contact us at [support@qazuor.com](mailto:support@qazuor.com).

## Security

### Is QZPay secure?

QZPay follows security best practices:

- No sensitive data stored (card numbers, etc. stay with the provider)
- Webhook signature verification
- Type-safe API to prevent common errors
- Regular security updates

### Does QZPay store credit card numbers?

No. QZPay never stores credit card numbers or other sensitive payment information. This data is handled by your payment provider (Stripe, MercadoPago, etc.) using their secure tokenization.

### How do I handle PCI compliance?

Since QZPay doesn't store card data, you can achieve PCI compliance through your payment provider's hosted solutions (Stripe Elements, MercadoPago Checkout Pro, etc.).
